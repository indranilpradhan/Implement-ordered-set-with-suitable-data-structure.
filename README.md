# Implement-ordered-set-with-suitable-data-structure.

An ordered set is a common data structure that supports O(log N) lookups, insertions
and removals. Ordered set is also sometimes used as an alternative to a hash map, for
example in STL’s map.
Following operation should be implemented on ordered set.
● insertion and removal.
● check if contains a value.
● to find the element in the set closest to some value.
● to find k-th largest element in the set.
● to count the number of elements in the set whose values fall into a
given range.
